                    <div class="info"><span>Hi, I'm Jayanth,</span> I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in 
                        Business Analytics at the University of North Texas. I consider myself to be a highly 
                        motivated and self-sufficient individual who is always striving to make informed decisions 
                        that take into account all the relevant facts, goals, constraints, and risks. Even in 
                        difficult or awkward interpersonal situations, I approach them positively and try to find 
                        a solution that benefits everyone involved. One of my strengths is my ability to remain calm 
                        and focused under pressure, which allows me to navigate turbulent situations with ease. 
                        I believe in maintaining an open and approachable manner and treating others with fairness 
                        and respect. I always make sure to preserve others' self-confidence and dignity, and I value
                        their opinions.
